#This is an example of a shel script that your shell must execute correctly
#notice that lines starting with a # sign are ignored as comments!
#let’s say this here file is called testme.sh.  you created it with say
#vi testme.sh ; chmod +x testme.sh
#you invoked it with
#./testme.sh
cat >cat.out
#at this point, type some lines at the keyboard, then create an EOF (Ctrl-D)
#your shell invoked the system cat command with output redirected to cat.out
cat cat.out
#you better see the lines that you just typed!
exit 123
#after your shell script exits, type echo $? from the UNIX system shell
#the value should be 123.  Since your shell just exited, the following
#bogus command should never be seen
